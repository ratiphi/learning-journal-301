Today we learned about functional programming.  FP is a style of programming
based on declarative programming that avoids state changing and mutable data.
The in class demo did this by using .map .filter and .reduce to morph a data
into what we needed rather changing the actual data itself.  The syntax and
usage of map filter reduce was a bit confusing to me at first.  In particular,
I was struggling with how to chain them properly to get the data we needed.
I got some help from Google and other students and now I understand it
better.  I still need lots of practice though.
