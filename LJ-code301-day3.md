Today we learned about JQuery events.  The string concatenation part of the Jquery selector from the lab assignment was very hard to understand at first.  Megan tried to explain it but I was not getting it.  I then realized that the input to the $() selector is just a line of CSS code, and has to be treated as a string.   This general concept could have been explained better in class.
