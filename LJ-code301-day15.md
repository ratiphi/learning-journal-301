Today my project team began our planning for the weather along a travel
route app.  I am not sure what we are calling it yet!  We looked closely
at a few weather APIs and at the Google maps API to try and figure out
how to do exactly what we want.  We are doing more research over this weekend
to get a better idea of what direction we want to take.
